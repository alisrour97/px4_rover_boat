A. Changes to do for simulating different modules in gazebo-classic:

1. Modify (.gitmodules): alisrour97/PX4-SITL_gazebo-classic.git

2. In (â€ŽROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes/)
	*Add File (1080_gazebo-classic_iris_delta_p1) related only to parameters which are constants and nominal
	*Edit CMakeLists as (ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes/CMakeLists.txt) to add inside [px4_add_romfs_files((1080_gazebo-classic_iris_delta_p1))]
	
3. In (Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/sitl_gazebo-classic/models)
	*Add folder (iris_delta_p1) including: ($name).sdf.jinja, /meshes/iris.stl , /meshes/iris_prop_ccw.dae, /meshes/iris_prop_cw.dae, model.config
	
4. Edit cmake (src/modules/simulation/simulator_mavlink/sitl_targets_gazebo-classic.cmake)
	*set(models      .. .. (iris_delta_p1))
	
5. In (Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/sitl_gazebo-classic/worlds)
	*Add folder jet_ski.world to be seen by SITL_run.sh
